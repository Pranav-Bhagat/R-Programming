```
##  1

```{r}
onlymales <- filter(medals, Sex == "M")
onlyfemales <- filter(medals, Sex == "F")
onlymales %>% count(Name) %>% arrange(desc(n))
onlyfemales %>% count(Name) %>% arrange(desc(n))
```

The male athlete with the most medals is Michael Phelps with 28 and the female athlete with the most medals is Larysa Semenivna Latynina with 18.


##  2
```{r}
one_name <- medals[!duplicated(medals$Name), ]
country_winners <- filter(one_name, Medal == "Gold")
most_gold_metals <- country_winners %>% group_by(Team) %>% count(Medal)
most_gold_metals %>% arrange(desc(n))

```

The Soviet Union has the second most gold medals with 600.

##  3
```{r}
mbasketball <- filter(medals, Event == "Basketball Men's Basketball")
wbasketball <- basketball <- filter(medals, Event == "Basketball Women's Basketball")
mbasketball %>% arrange(Year)
wbasketball %>% arrange(Year)
```
Men's basketball was first introduced in 1936 and the Women's basketball was first introduced 1976.



##  4
```{r}
americans <- filter(medals, Sex ==  "F", NOC == "USA", Year == "2016")
americans %>% group_by(Sex) %>% summarize_at(vars(Weight, Height), funs(mean))
```

The average height of the Americans is 176 units of height and the average weight is 69.1 units of weight.

##  5
```{r}
one_city <- medals[!duplicated(medals$Games), ]
total_count <- one_city %>% count(City)
total_count %>% arrange(desc(n))
```

Athina and London have hosted the most Olympic Games with 3 each.

##Recreate a Plot
```{r}
high_countries <- filter(medals, Team == "United States" | Team == "Soviet Union", Medal == "Gold", Year > 1949, Year < 1990)

high_countries <- high_countries %>% distinct(Event, Year, .keep_all = TRUE)

ggplot(high_countries, aes(x = Year, fill = Team))+
  geom_bar()+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1952, 1956, 1960, 1964, 1968, 1972, 1976, 1980, 1984, 1988))+
  ggtitle("Gold Medals in Olympic Games between 1950 and 1989")

```

The years 1980 and 1984 standout to me because of the lobsided number of medals won by each country. 
In 1980, the Soviet Union hosted the Olympics and the United States hosted it in 1984. 
The Soviets won the majoirty of the medals in 1980 and the United States won the majoirty in 1984. 
This could be due to the Soviet-Afghan war which led the US to protest the Olympics when hosted by the
Soviets and rhe USSR to boycott the Olympics when it was hosted by the United States.


##Open Ended Question
```{r}
top10 <- filter(medals, Team == "United States" | Team == "China" | Team == "Great Britain" | Team == "Italy" | Team == "Hungary" | Team == "Sweden" | Team == "Australia" | Team == "France" | Team == "Soviet Union" | Team == "Germany")

ggplot(top10, aes(x = as.factor(Team), y = Height, fill = Team)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```


The graph above displays the 10 countries with the most gold medals. China is a major outlier as 
their height is lower than the other countries. The US seems to have the greatest variability, along
with the Soviet Union, because of the large amount of athletes they had in the Olympics compared to other 
countries. We can also see that most of the medians of height are around the same for countries with the top 10 medals.
