Charles Samuel is the oldest.

```{r}
congress_age %>% count(incumbent)
```


```{r}
recent <- filter(congress_age, congress == 113, party == "R" | party == "D")
```


```{r}
onehunnid <- filter(congress_age, congress == 100)

onehunnid %>% count(incumbent)

```
There were 63 new congresspeople in the 100th Congress.

```{r}
congress_age %>% group_by(chamber) %>% summarize_at(vars(age), funs(mean))
```


The Senate is older.

```{r}
ggplot(recent, aes(x = as.factor(party), y = age, fill = party)) +
  geom_boxplot()

```

They are stagnant since they are the same age, neglecting the younger citizens beliefs. 
Also, the criticism is valid because the average age is in the mid-50's for both parties, 
which is pretty high age considering that most new ideas come from people of younger ages. 
This critcism is not equally valid for both parties because the average age for Democrats 
is 59.6 for Democrats while the average age for Republicans is 55.8, so although there is 
not a huge difference, there is still a slight difference in the ages which could allow for
more new ideas to be part of the political conversation compared to Democrats.
