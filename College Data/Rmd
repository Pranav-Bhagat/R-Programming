```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
colleges <- read_csv("https://www.dropbox.com/s/1ja0pnpiaoh9ykl/colleges1995.csv?dl=1")
```

```{r}
colleges <- colleges %>% mutate(
  Name = gsub("California State Univ. at", "CSU", Name),
  Name = gsub("California State University at", "CSU", Name),
  Name = gsub("California Polytechnic", "Cal Poly", Name),
  Name = gsub("California Poly", "Cal Poly", Name),
  Name = gsub("University of California at", "UC", Name)
)
```

##  Adjusting and Cleaning Data
```{r}
CA_public <- colleges %>%
  filter(State == "CA" & Type == "Public") %>%
  select(Name, Avg.SAT, Acceptance.Rate, Size, Tuition) %>%
  drop_na()
```
drop_na() in the fourth line removed all the times in the dataset where there were rows containing missing values.


##  Querying Data
```{r}
colleges %>% arrange(Tuition)
```

Franklin and Marshall has the highest out of state tuition in this data at $24,940.

```{r}
colleges %>% arrange(Acceptance.Rate)
```

Stanford University has the lowest acceptance rate in this data at 21.5%.

```{r}
CA_public %>% arrange(Size)
```

San Diego State is the largest public university in California.

```{r}
colleges <- colleges %>%
  mutate(
    BFB = factor((Avg.SAT) / (Tuition * Acceptance.Rate)))

colleges %>% arrange(BFB)
  
```

In my opnion, Boise State University has the best "bang for your buck."

##  Plot
```{r}
ggplot(colleges, aes(x = Tuition, fill = Type)) +
  geom_bar() +
  facet_grid(~Type) +
  stat_bin(binwidth = 787.76)
```
```{r}
ggplot(colleges, aes(x = as.factor(Type), y = Size, fill = Type)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  xlab("Type") +
  ylab("Size")
```
```{r}
States <- filter(colleges, State == "CA"| State == "NY"| State == "TX")

ggplot(States, aes(x = State, fill = Type)) +
  geom_bar()
```

```{r}
ggplot(colleges, aes(x = Avg.SAT, y = Tuition)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(~Type)
```
